# Hi!!
Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Mary, and I am a sophomore at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Electrical & Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.

My projects mainly involve hardware/software integration, with focus on PCB design, FPGA design, and programming in C, C++, Python & VHDL. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to my projects.


## What's next?
* Practicing machine learning basics using TensorFlow Lite on my Raspberry Pi 4
* Continue working on RedPitaya FPGA Traffic Light Controller core
* Implementing a CPU Emulator in C++ to run testbenches on
* Learning Docker (because why not?)
